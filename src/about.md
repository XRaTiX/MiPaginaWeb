{{ page.description }} I'm 21 years old and my pronouns are he/him.

I am currently a part of the [KDE QA](https://invent.kde.org/groups/teams/qa/-/group_members?with_inherited_permissions=exclude&search=theevilskeleton) team, a member of the [GNOME Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/#:~:text=Hans%20de%20Goede-,Hari%20Rana,-Heather%20Ellsworth), developer of [Bottles](https://usebottles.com/), part of the [Fedora Editorial board](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-magazine/editorial-meetings/#:~:text=chair%20glb%20rlengland-,theevilskeleton,-cverna%20asamalik) and writer at Fedora Magazine, and part of the Fedora quality assurance team. I'm also helping to revamp the [Fedora Project's website](https://gitlab.com/fedora/websites-apps/fedora-websites/fedora-websites-3.0).

I want to contribute to [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and the adoption of the Linux desktop, by advocating various free and open source technologies. I write articles as a hobby, mainly about Linux. My content are meant for educational purposes.

I enjoy watching anime and cartoons, but I am extremely picky about them. My favorite anime are [Baccano!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccano!) and [Durarara!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durarara!!), as these stories focus on various characters and different sides of the story. Both stories are written by [Ryōgo Narita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dgo_Narita).

As for my favorite cartoons, they are [The Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) and [The Legend of Korra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra). These are my favorites for the same reason as Baccano! and Durarara!!, additionally the character development throughout the story.

My favorite movies are [Kung Fu Panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda) and [How to Train Your Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon). Just like The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, there's a lot of character development in these stories.

My favorite video game is [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/). It is a sandbox tower-defense game that is challenging and requires a lot of dedication.
